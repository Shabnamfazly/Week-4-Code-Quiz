# Week-4-Code-Quiz

## Description

This project is a code quiz application using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This application emphasizes the use of Javascript to provide quiz questions as well as collecting user data to determine whether the answers to a question are correct or incorrect, this then generates a score and appends a final page of results from the user data stored in the local storage.

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To get this project up and running, you can follow the deployment link. 

## Usage

The application is simple to use with just a press of the button "Begin Quiz" the user will be taken to the multiple choice questions which they can answer and then the user will be given the option to save their score as well as viewing their highscores.
